Installation of pnUserPictures
==============================



1. Requirements:

    - The programm "convert" from ImageMagick has to be installed

    - the gd library has to be installed and php has to compiled 
    with this library

    - The directory modules/UserPictures/data hast to be read- and
      writeable by the webserver! (chmod 777 for example)
      
    - the shell_exec-command in php must have been enabled
    
    - Plese check your php memory limit if you decide to use the 
    gdlib thumbnail creation. You might have to increase it
      

2. Installation:

    - Activate the module in the postnuke module administration

    
3. Integration

    You want to integrate pictures in a profile for example?
    
    <!--[pnmodapifunc modname="UserPictures" type="user" func="showPicture" uid=$uid template_id=1 assign=profilepic]-->
    <!--[$profilepic.code]--><br />
    <!--[$profilepic.comment]-->
    
    This above is an example for a profile picture. Customize 
    this (template_id, variables) for your needs.
    
    The array that returns from the function call above has more
    variables inside than code and comment but please don't use them!
			     

Have a lot of fun.
